/collections/  -> gives object of collections data such as {
    collection id,
    shcema,
    api filter
}


see mondel.watch() and according make schemas chagnes
also look at webapi of pocketbase

db.js line 27

opearationType : "insert" || "update" || "delete"
fullDocument -->data inserted
documentKey  --> on update and delete

node --watch-path=./ --env-file=./.env index.js 

TO FIX:-
1.onupdate collection name makes new collection,should make changes to current collection name.
2.look at onupate collection as records should also be removed but logic not written.
